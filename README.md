# HW11
The design objective of this project is to control 6 LEDs 
so that they light up sequentially in the order of switching one light every 10 seconds,
 thus realising a simple time display effect.

Sequential LED Lighting: 6 LEDs light up one at a time, with each LED remaining lit for 10 seconds.
Automatic Timing: The program calculates time using the millis() function.
